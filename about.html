    <p>I've always had a passion for design, but I lacked the confidence to pursue it full time. I'm a mother of two (boy and girl), and I 
    decided now is the best time to pivot. </p>
    <p>I enjoy problem solving. My background consists of analytical problem solving (banking industry) and great attention to detail.
    My hopes for this course is to learn technical problem solving to advance design solutions. I would love to bring my designs to life with interactive code.</p>
    <p>My favorite food right now is rice. I eat all kinds of rice: fried, white, brown, etc</p>
